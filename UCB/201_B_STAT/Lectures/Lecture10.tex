\subsection{Nonparametric Methods} % (fold)

We have $X_1,\dots,X_n \iid F$, which we have no information about.


Bootstrap: Resample with replacement from the data $X_1,\dots,X_n$ to get $X_1^*,\dots,X_n^*$. Then compute the statistic of interest $T_n^* = T(X_1^*,\dots,X_n^*)$. Repeat this many times to get an empirical distribution of $T_n^*$, which approximates the sampling distribution of $T_n = T(X_1,\dots,X_n)$.

Say we have done $B$ bootstrap samples, and we have $T_{n,1}^*,\dots,T_{n,B}^*$. Then we have a vector $(T_{n,1}^*,\dots,T_{n,B}^*)$.
