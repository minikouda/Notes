\section*{Problem 4 SVD Transformation}
\begin{problem}

In this problem we will interpret the linear map defined by matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ by looking at its singular value
decomposition, $A = U D V^\top$. Recall that here $U, D, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $U, V$ are orthonormal matrices while
$D$ is a diagonal matrix. We will first look at how $V^\top$, $D$ and $U$ each separately transform the unit circle
$$C = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 \le 1\}$$ and then look at their effect as a whole.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
Let $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\vec{z} = V^\top \vec{x}$. Show that
\[
\vec{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \vec{v}_i,
\]
where $\vec{z} = [z_1 \ \cdots \ z_n]^\top$
and $V = [\vec{v}_1 \ \cdots \ \vec{v}_n]$.
This shows that $\vec{z}$ is the vector of coordinates that represents $\vec{x}$ in the basis defined
by the columns of $V$.

For the rest of the problem we restrict ourselves to the case where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$
and move to the notebook.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Answer}

Since $V$ is an orthonormal matrix, we have $V^\top V = I$. Therefore,
\[
\vec{z} = V^\top \vec{x} \implies V \vec{z} = V V^\top \vec{x} = \vec{x}.
\]

where $V \vec{z} = z_1 \vec{v}_1 + \cdots + z_n \vec{v}_n$ is the linear combination of the columns of $V$ with coefficients given by the entries of $\vec{z}$.
